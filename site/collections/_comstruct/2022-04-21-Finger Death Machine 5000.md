### Description

Our game is a 2-player competitive showdown where both players compete against each other for the highest score by completing a series of matrix patterns shown to them with a series of LEDs arranged in a 4 by 4 matrix. Each game is 60 seconds long beyond which users can reset the game. 

The game proceeds in mini rounds of 5 seconds and the overall winner will be the one who accumulates the greatest number of points at the end of 60 seconds. At each round, a random LED light-up is generated and players will have to press the buttons for a certain number of times corresponding to the LED light-up shown in the fastest possible time in order to win that round. If a player accidentally presses more than the required number of LEDs, they immediately lose the round and have to wait for their competitor until the mini round is over or the competitor also makes a mistake.
