### Description

“Where do you want to eat?” — a question that everyone has faced, and many struggle to answer. Most people pull out their phones and ask Google for inspiration, others dig deep and rack their brains, some shrug and say “idk”. Only a rare handful are able to decisively settle on an option.

BiteBook aims to solve this by being your personal food diary and recommender. Imagine if you had a list of all the restaurants you’ve ever eaten at before and enjoyed, categorized by location, price, cuisine, all rated and reviewed by you.

A Home page that shows your latest eats, an Add page that autofills data, a Decide page to help you choose, a Map page that shows your favourite locations — BiteBook is here to simplify your decision-making process and make sure you enjoy every single meal :>
