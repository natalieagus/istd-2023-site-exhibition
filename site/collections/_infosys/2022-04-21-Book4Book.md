### Description

HBook4Book is a smartphone application designed to help book-lovers find more books to read without breaking the bank, while increasing the life cycle of the books that have already been read. Our app allows users to upload a book that they would like to trade, as well as to browse and view existing trade listings posted by fellow users. When the user sees a listing he is interested in, he can chat with the user who has uploaded the listing, where they can begin the negotiations regarding the details of the trade. Finally, our app also allows users to manage their profile and listings, where they can upload a profile photo and remove listings that have already been completed.  All in all, we hope to build the book-lovers community and make reading books a more sustainable and environmentally friendly hobby for everyone. *What are you waiting for? Trade now!*
