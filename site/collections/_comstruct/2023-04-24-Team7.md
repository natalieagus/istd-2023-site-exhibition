### Description

Introducing the Harmonic Waterfall Warriors, a captivating and interactive game designed to challenge players' hand-eye coordination, reflexes, and response to visual stimuli. Developed by Team 7, this project utilizes a 16-bit ALU, Harmonic Waterfall Warriors features a stunning LED waterfall, large responsive buttons, and an easy-to-understand scoring system, providing players with an exhilarating gaming experience like no other.

The objective of the game is to press corresponding buttons as cascading LED lights reach the bottom row, earning points for successful presses and losing points for missed ones. The final score is calculated after 60 seconds of gameplay. Inspired by the mobile game Piano Tiles, our game adds a combo system, point deductions for incorrect button presses. At the final 10 second sprint, the tiles speed up to maintain engagement and challenge. The game's vibrant LED lights and intuitive tactile buttons create an immersive and visually appealing environment that players of all ages can enjoy.
