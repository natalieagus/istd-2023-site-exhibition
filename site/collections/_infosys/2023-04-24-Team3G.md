### Description

PLANTMI is a plant-care application aimed at busy plant-enthusiasts who do not have time to monitor and water their indoor plants constantly and frequently while away from home. With PLANTMI, users simply set up an account linked to each plant to keep track of their plants’ health through the real-time plant moisture level, light intensity, temperature and humidity sensors even while outside of home. PLANTMI is equipped with 3 ways of watering – a self watering system when a moisture level of less than 15% is detected, manual pressing of a button in-app to water immediately, or setting a time to water automatically. Users are able to view the history of plant status data and also check on the water level in the water tank.
