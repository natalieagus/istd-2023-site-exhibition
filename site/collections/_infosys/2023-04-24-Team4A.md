### Description

Navit aims to simplify the planning of itineraries that match users' interests and time constraints. We target tourists who are new to an area as well as people who want spontaneous but optimised plans. Users provide the app with the country they are visiting, the number of days, followed by the place that they will return to each day, such as their hotel or home. Then, they can enter all of the places that they want to visit and voila, the app provides them with the order that they should visit the places in order to minimise the amount of time spent travelling. Thus, this is a useful and lightweight tool for people who want to get around a new and unfamiliar place quickly.
