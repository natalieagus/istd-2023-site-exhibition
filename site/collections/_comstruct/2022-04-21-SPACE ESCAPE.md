### Description

For our 50.002 project, we have created a single-player game called Beat City. The objective of the game is to score the highest amount of points possible before the lights reach the bottom. This is a game whereby the player must observe a series of LED lights and then press the buttons with the corresponding colors to clear the bottom-most LED light.The coloured LED will move down after a specific time from the top to the bottom. 

After a certain amount of points scored by the player, a new level is reached and the lights will move down at a faster speed. There are 3 different coloured lights and their corresponding buttons: red, green and blue. A fourth coloured light, white, is added whereby any of the three buttons can be pressed to clear the colour. 

If the player presses the wrong button, a penalty is incurred such that all the lights will move down immediately. The game ends when the LED lights reaches the bottom and overflows, and the final score will be displayed on the 7 seg on the top right of the game.
