### Description
The onset of COVID-19 has changed many aspects of our life, especially the way we learn. Instead of physically attending classes, students have shifted to an increasingly digitised and individualised learning process. This method of learning has created a lack of opportunities for students to socialise and meet friends who they can study with and in turn, has affected their ability to find groupmates when assigned group projects in educational institutes.

Mugr is an instant solution to this problem. We have created an online community for students through which they can connect with other students who have similar studying preferences as them. Upon creating an account with Mugr, the student is given an option to fill up a study habits preference form and can input their contact information there as well. Through an algorithm, Mugr generates the best matches for the student to find the optimum study buddy. After being matched, the student can view the study buddyâ€™s Telegram handle and contact one another from there. They can even match their calendars to find the optimum studying time. Not only does the student find their optimum study buddy, the student is able to connect with other students through our online forum in which the student can ask other students homework questions and discuss the solutions to help each other! We hope that through this new solution, students are provided with a platform which makes working on group projects and socialising during this pandemic easier!
