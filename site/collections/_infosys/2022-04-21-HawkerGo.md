### Description

This project aims to digitalise and present information on hawker stalls in a useful, easy-to-use, and fun manner. Currently, important information about hawker stalls like opening hours, menus and reviews is sparse, outdated and scattered across the web. Thus, our problem is as follows: How might we digitalise and present information on hawker stalls in a useful, easy-to-use, and fun manner?

HawkerGo aims to be a single, centralised resource for users to view and review hawker stalls and hawker centres in Singapore. We organise information on hawker centre stalls and present them in an easy to access manner (e.g., opening hours, stall number etc). We also help people locate suitable food stalls in each hawker centre using various filters with tags that represent dietary restrictions and cuisine type. Additionally, users can add in new hawker centres and stalls that they chance across through an online form on the app, they can also add in their reviews with pictures of the food from each stall. This helps to populate our app with real and updated information. Ultimately, we also wish to build a vibrant community of hawker lovers on our platform and keep the hawker culture in Singapore alive!
