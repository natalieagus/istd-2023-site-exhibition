### Description

Traffic Light Showdown is a player versus player game to test your ability to react quickly and accurately. There will be 9 rounds and the game will get progressively harder as the round duration decreases from 5 seconds to 3 (round 3-6) and 1 second (round 7-9).

At every round, there will be a coloured word that is displayed. Depending on whether the round is a “WORD” or “COLOUR” round as shown by light posts in the middle, the player will have to press the right button accordingly.

Example: The word “red” appears on the green 7-segment displays. If it is a “WORD” round, the correct answer will be to press the red button. Otherwise if it is a “COLOUR” round, the correct answer will be to press the green button.

The winner will be the one with the highest score after 9 rounds. A draw is possible for this game. Now, you have understood the rules, it’s time to TRAFFIC LIGHT SHOWDOWN.
