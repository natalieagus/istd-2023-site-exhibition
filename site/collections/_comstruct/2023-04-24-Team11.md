### Description

Huat! is a slot machine with “rolling” displays, featuring unique symbols on 8x8 LEDs. Insert coins into the slot, watch as the cherries and hearts come tumbling down, and hope to strike the elusive triple 7s as you pull the lever!!!! Play as long as you like or until you run out of money

Using an FPGA, a lot of LEDs, and the combined acumen of our entire team, we’ve built the ultimate luck tester that won’t bankrupt you (yet, hopefully). Admire the beautiful construction of our slot machine with its engraved wood panelling, lovingly handcrafted by our team members in FabLab.
