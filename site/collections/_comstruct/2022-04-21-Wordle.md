### Description

This project is inspired by the popular online word-guessing game, Wordle. It is a single-player game where the player guesses the word of the day (5-letter word) in 6 attempts. The player is also provided with clues on the closeness of their guesses.

Our project transforms the software nature of the game into a piece of handcrafted hardware, in the form of an arcade-like machine. To make the game simpler, our project requires players to guess a random 4-letter word in 5 attempts. To make it more engaging, players can reset the game anytime to guess another randomly generated word.

An accessible hardware user interface is provided, making it easy to play the game. It consists of 26 alphabet buttons in the QWERTY layout for easy input of guesses, various guess buttons to display their previous guesses, 2 rows of LED matrices, where the top row shows the previous guesses, where each letter lights up in certain colours to emulate the clues, and the bottom row shows the current input. There are other buttons for game control too.

All in all, our project reproduced the original game into a more engaging hardware variant.
