### Description

Welcome to CROSSYBIT! The aim of the game is to cross from the first to the last row while avoiding the blue enemies by moving up, down, left and right. There are 4 levels to the game. From levels 1 to 3, the enemies will move faster and faster. And in level 4, the controls get inverted!

The FPGA was used to implement the 6502 CPU architecture, the same CPU architecture used in the Commodore 64 & NES. The game was coded in 6502 assembly. The game uses 21 zero-page addresses for storing various variables like player position. The displays are controlled by 8 absolute addresses which allows the game to display any colour to any pixel on the 8x8 LED grid, and also display any number on the 2 separate 8-segment displays. The buttons are mapped to memory, and also cause an Interrupt Request when pressed, which allows the CPU to handle inputs quickly.
