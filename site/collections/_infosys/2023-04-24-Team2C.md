### Description

Too many food places and I don’t know which to choose. Have you and your friends ever spent precious time in a new area wondering where you should eat at? Fret not, use Hungry Alpacas!

Hungry Alpacas aids to tackle indecisiveness in food options. By using Google Map’s API, one can obtain a list of restaurants in their proximity. With the data obtained, users can randomise this list, in the form of spin-the-wheel, to choose a restaurant the user can visit.

To further aid with this decision paralysis, Hungry Alpacas features a blocklist for more adventurous users. The application records previously visited restaurants and removes them from the current lists, allowing users to try new foods with every use of the app.
With a focus on simplicity, Hungry Alpacas functions to alleviate the stress from one’s everyday meal choice overload, allowing them to focus on the essential.
