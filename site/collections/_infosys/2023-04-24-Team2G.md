### Description

The problem with today’s tour services is that they are commercialised which makes it less personalised and restrictive. Tourists are unable to freely enjoy themselves as they may not be able to do things at their own pace and schedule. They may have no choice but to take part in activities that are part of a package they bought even though they are interested. Our team aims to resolve this problem with app that allow travellers to enjoy the freedom of free and easy travel while overcoming the unfamiliarity of the environment.

One user will be able to take up to profiles, either a ‘Tour Guide’ or a ‘Tourist’. Think of the Tour Guide as someone who gives tours on a freelance basis, like a freelance food-delivery rider for example. Ideally, our Tour Guides will give tours based on his/her interest like Food if they are a foodie, or nature if they’re an outdoors person. While as a tourist, you explore for tours in the vicinity around you!

Core features:
Tourists:

1. View tour listings sorted increasing proximity to them or through a map view
2. Filter tour listings by tags such as "Food” and “Nature”
3. RSVP to tour listings

Tour Guides:

1. Create tour listings
2. View and edit current tour listings
3. View, accept and decline RSVPs to tour listings
