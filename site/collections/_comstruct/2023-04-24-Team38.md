### Description

Inspired by the popular arcade game “Whack-a-Mole” and the mobile application “Tap Tap Revenge”, in this game, players are required to hit the buttons that correspond to the LED lights that are glowing to get points and win the game.

After pressing the start button situated on the FPGA, all four LED lights will glow indicating that you need to select a level (Easy, Medium, Difficult, Impossible). Each level has a different speed of changing LED lights.

Pressing the button corresponding to the currently glowing LED bulb will gain you one point. If you hit the wrong button or if you are too slow, a point is deducted. The point of the game is to collect as many points as possible. If you are losing more points than you are gaining, you can click the start button again to stop the game.

Minimum Attainable Score: 0
Maximum Attainable Score: 9999
