### Description

Mahjong tiles is a 2-Player-game. Each player has 2 rows of 7 LEDs, 2 buttons and a score.

Each player starts with 7 “tiles” represented by 7 LEDs numbered 1 through 7. Each turn, a player sends out one tile. A player cannot select a tile that had already been selected.

For each round, the player that selects the higher numbered tile will win points that are equal to the sum of his tile number and his opponent’s tile number. For example, Player A selects tile 6 and Player B selects tile 7. Then, Player B will win 6+7=13 points.

Ties nullify both players’ tiles and they are not scored. For example, if Player A selects tile 6 and Player B also selects tile 6, then both players will win no points and tile 6 will become unavailable to both players.

The player with the highest score after 7 tiles are played is the winner.
The player can press the red button to cycle through their current selection in the first row of LEDs (closer to player) and press the green button to lock in their choice. The second row of LEDs shows the available tiles left.
