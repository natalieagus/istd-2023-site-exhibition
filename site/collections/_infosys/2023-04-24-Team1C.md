### Description

“Everyone I contacted already has a group ” “I need to find someone who can write Bogosort” “My friends like to work at midnight when I like to sleep ” These are some potential problems SUTD’s students may face when taking on project work in school. SUTD’s academic curriculum is relatively project centric, with students typically anywhere from 3-5 projects per term to contend with. Finding groupmates can be a challenge and fairly often is a frantic, hectic process, much less groupmates with complementary skill sets and similar visions. Students may feel that this ‘free-for-all’ system of group formation leaves much to be desired.

Hence, our smartphone app, Groopr, seeks to bridge this gap and enable SUTDents to fish for groups or members to join with ease. With Groopr, you need not grapple with mismatched skill sets, differences in working styles, or cold-war group dynamics that can hinder you and others from achieving your fullest potential!

As one might have guessed, our app’s core function is to provide students the ability to form project groups more smoothly. One can either form a group and await prospective members’ applications, or hunt for a group themselves. The groups are tagged to the respective modules they’re for, based on the student’s pillar. Users can indicate needed skills in the process of group creation or modification, and the tags will be clearly displayed to those in search of groups. Future functionalities may include messaging to further streamline the process, or a data-driven recommendations feature that recommends groups to users or vice versa.

All in all, the hassles of scouring to assemble your next Avengers team is made possible with merely a few taps and swipes within Groopr.
