### Description

FEAST is a real time crowd tracking app that allows users to conveniently check the current crowd levels at various food and beverage establishments in SUTD. Using the app, users can avoid establishments that are crowded, or choose to come back later. Gone are the days when users need to waste time queueing and thus can better plan their day to avoid large crowds.

Using open-source computer vision technology, we can tap into CCTV data to autonomously track crowds moving in and out of a location, which is updated to our database and displayed seamlessly on the FEAST app.

Accompanying the crowd tracking functionality are a suite of features that improve user experience in the app, such as predictive estimated waiting time, customisability by prioritising user preferred locations, and real-time business hours advisory.

Built using modular design principles, our FEAST app has a plug-and-play model that allows easy implementation at any location with its own set of F&B Establishments, and even contains the infrastructure to expand beyond F&B to track crowd levels of other locations.
