### Description


Study Buddy is an events app that aims to make learning more targeted and collaborative outside of the classroom.

Apart from the basic features like joining and creating events, the key feature of our app is that it provides a platform where you can easily find module-focused study events using our module filters. This allows students to seek help for the modules that they are struggling with.

Study buddy maintains a beautiful user interface design and it is simple for users to create their events in less than a minute. It is also like any other networking application where you’re able to view one’s profile and potentially have them as your study buddy.
