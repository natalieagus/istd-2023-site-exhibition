### Description

Our project is Spacemate, an app that allows its users to book spaces within the SUTD campus in advance, and check the occupancy of such spaces to streamline group discussions. In SUTD, students often work in common spaces such as outside the Albert Hong lecture theatre, in the library, or outside cohort classrooms. However, as finals and project deadlines draw near, these spaces are usually full, leaving other groups to walk around campus to manually check for spaces. This results in wasted time and a loss of productivity.
