### Description

Have you ever gone to the canteen before only to find out that your favourite stall has closed? Are you sad that you will not be able to get dinner on time now? Be sad no more! The MyCanteen@SUTD app shows the general users all the stalls that are open at any time and all the dishes that are available at each stall. Never again will you have to worry about going to the canteen in doubt!

Are you a stall owner at the canteen and are worried that all your food will not be sold out and that there will be wastage by the end of the day? Worry no more! The MyCanteen@SUTD app will show you an estimate of the number of customers expected to turn up at the canteen, and it can be used as a guide to help prepare the right amount of food so that there is no leftover/food wastage!
