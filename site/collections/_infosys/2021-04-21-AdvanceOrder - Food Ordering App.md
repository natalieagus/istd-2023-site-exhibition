### Description

Is the queue in the SUTD canteen too long? Do you wish you could order food in advance anytime, anywhere? Whether you are a hungry customer or an enterprising vendor, AdvanceOrder is the app for you. 

AdvanceOrder is split into 2 broad sections: The User/Customer side and the Vendor side. Logging in as a Vendor allows you to track the orders that your stall is currently processing and allows you to choose which order to prepare and serve first, notifying the customer when their order is ready.

Meanwhile, logging in as a Customer brings you to a home screen where one can choose to browse restaurants, track the status of one’s active orders, and top up one’s virtual currency. 

With a cashless payment system and a convenient set of features, AdvaneOrder allows you to skip the queues and place customised orders easily while contributing to a sustainable lifestyle.
