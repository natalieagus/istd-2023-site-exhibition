### Description

TimeSync is a Timetable Management app that enables multiple users to easily check and manage their personal timetable. Designed to help facilitate the organisation of meetings, our app uses a Firebase to synchronise all users’ timetables and returns an organised view of everyone’s timetables. Featuring a simple and easily understood User Interface, TimeSync allows any user to go from registering an account to setting up their own timetable within less than half an hour. 

Each user will be able to register their own account in the Firebase database to prevent external tampering and help identify which members are available during a particular timing. Users will also be able to add descriptions to commonly available slots to allow users to clarify additional details for future meetings. All in all, TimeSync will help users avoid the tedium and headaches of having to organise events individually. Avoid time sinks, with TimeSync!
