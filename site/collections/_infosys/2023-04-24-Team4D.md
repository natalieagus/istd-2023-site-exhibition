### Description

Aiya is an app where you can post about the environmental troubles you encounter in your daily life and cast a spotlight on them, and avoid places full of hazards. Aiya is quick and easy to use with a real time map and customized markers to see what hazards are in your surroundings and posts detailing them, complete with photos of said hazards!

Use Aiya to notify others of potholes and water shortages, and get your local council to acknowledge the issues! Singaporeans can use their kampong spirit to work together in keeping the community safe for themselves, their neighbours, and their community animals. No more tediously filling up reports and wondering if they even read your form - ensure that your complaints are seen and heard by everyone!
