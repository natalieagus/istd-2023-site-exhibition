### Description

Canteen Rush is a two-player game where players race each other’s character by controlling their character (depicted by a green light on an LED array) using buttons. The goal of the game is to reach the finish line (the middle of a 32-row LED array) from the starting line (the first and last rows of the LED array). Two players will start from both sides respectively and race to the finish line while avoiding obstacles (depicted by red lights on the array). If a player navigates to a spot with an obstacle (i.e. the green light moves to a pixel that has a red light) the green light will respawn at the starting line and the player has to start again while their opponent can continue their game.

The game is inspired by the rush to queue for the ban mian stall in the SUTD canteen and Frogger, a classic arcade game where a frog moves forward while avoiding obstacles to reach a pond. Originally, Frogger was designed to be single-player, but we modified it to be 2-player to make the game more exciting as the players can compete with each other.
