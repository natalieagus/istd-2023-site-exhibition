### Description

We have built a game wherein you need to guess the button the other player presses! The game has 2 players – an attacker and a defender. The attacker needs to guess which button the defender has pressed. If they fail to do so the defender gains points based on the button number he/she pressed. The button pressed by the defender will now be revealed, and the players can plan their next moves.
To help make the game more exciting, we added an incentive for the defender to press the same button. If the defender presses the same button they pressed in the previous round, they get five additional bonus points. This will make the game quite strategic, wherein the players try to beat each other in a psychological warfare setting.
Once the attacker guesses the defender’s button, the roles are switched. At the end of the game, i.e., after both players guess each other’s buttons, the player with the higher points wins.
