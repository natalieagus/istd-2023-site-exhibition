### Description

Our game, Pixel Run, is inspired by the game “Subway Surfers”, but now we have five lanes instead of three! Our game UI is the one on the right.

Player presses the green start button. Upon pressing the button, the game starts. There will be 5 lanes for the player to move. The player can either move right or left. The player has to collect coins on the path and avoid obstacles. The game speed will change as the player progresses without crashing into obstacles to increase game difficulty.

The player accumulates score by surviving as long as possible and collecting coins. The high score system keeps track of the highest score achieved (time survived in seconds + number of coins collected) within the game session.
