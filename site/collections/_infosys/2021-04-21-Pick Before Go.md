### Description

Tired of going to Pick & GO only to find out that the item you want to buy is out of stock? Want to stay updated on promotions of the most popular items? Introducing the Pick Before Go app, a revamped user experience where users can get the most out of their Pick & GO experience. 

Opening the app brings you to our home screen, with the classic QR code for entry and a promotion carousel to view the current promotions in store. To browse through the product catalogue on your way to Pick & GO, simply use the search bar in the app to search for any product and tap on it. Not only will you be able to see its availability, you will also get to see a short description about it! You can even favourite items for quick access.

But Pick & GO wouldnâ€™t survive without the operational staff restocking the items everyday. With special administrator privileges, staff can also use the app as an inventory tool for operational tasks such as updating the promotions and availability of items. They can also easily add a new product if needed!

With Pick Before Go, shopping at Pick & GO has never been easier and fuss-free!
