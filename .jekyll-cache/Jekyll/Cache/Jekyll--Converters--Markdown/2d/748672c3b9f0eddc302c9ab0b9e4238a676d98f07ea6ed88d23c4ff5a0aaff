<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>Deez StackÃ«e is a fast-paced stacking game to test your reflexes. There are a total of 8 levels that get progressively more difficult. The goal is to align rows of LED(s) starting from the bottom level on top of each other until it reaches the highest level within a time limit of 60 seconds.</p>

<p>Each row of LED lights (LED block per lighted LED cell), starting from the bottom row, will continuously oscillate left and right until the player presses the button to stop the LED lights from moving.</p>

<p>Players can choose to stop anywhere they want, and LED blocks on the level above will begin oscillating. As the game progresses, LED blocks will stack on top of the previous level. LED blocks not directly on top of any blocks from the previous level will be removed.</p>
