### Description

This project is a simple game inspired by the popular telegram game “Lumberjack”.
In Lumberjack, you play as a retired lumberjack participating in a taekwondo competition to see who can kick down the most branches on a never-ending grown tree. The game aims to train the player’s hand-eye connection and coordination.
Make use of the left and right buttons to dodge and kick down the branches growing on each side of the tree. Remember to protect your head, you immediately lose if a branch hits you. Try to survive 60 seconds to be the winner!
(ps. You can also aim for the high score and beat your friends!)
