### Description

Panda-Monium is our iteration of popular maze oriented games. Users can interact with the game via the navigation buttons to pave their way through the maze carefully avoiding the walls. The entire map can be visualised using 8 led strips. The colour red indicates a wall and the panda is represented by the colour blue. The user can win a round by successfully navigating from the starting point to the end point which is denoted by the colour purple. Our gameâ€™s unique selling point is the implementation of a rotating direction, which will change after a few moves of the panda. Hence after a stipulated period of time, each button would be mapped to a different output. There are 3 unique levels for the user to navigate through to win the game.
