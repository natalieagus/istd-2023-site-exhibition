### Description

This project is inspired by a childhood game commonly found in arcades and carnivals. The goal of the game is to shoot as many balls through a vertically upright board with holes of varying sizes while standing five feet away from it. The smaller the size of the hole, the more points the player is awarded when he/she manages to throw balls through the holes. The user has 60 seconds to throw 10 balls through the holes. The game ends either when 10 balls has passed through the holes or the user runs out of time.
