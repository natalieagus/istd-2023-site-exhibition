### Description
The idea for our 1D project came from our collective fondness of games from the time gone by and love for all the different life-forms we share our world with i.e. animals.

Our game Zootopia takes on the task of putting a classic twist on a single-player game that everyone is familiar with, Hangman. The premise of Zootopia rests on being a fun, interactive word-game where the player makes guesses at the letters of the word with a limited number of lives (3 to be exact). While this describes the basic idea of the game, the inclusion of several levels, the added atmosphere created by the carefully color-curated LEDs, the rustic arcade theme given off by the hardware design etc. truly makes it a memorable experience.

In each round, a 5-letter animal word is chosen randomly from a list. The player needs to guess 2 consecutive words correctly before moving to the next level, and the player will have to complete all 3 levels to win the game. Each level is harder than the last, with later levels featuring animals that are more obscure or contain less common letters in their names.

For each word, the player has 3 lives to guess the correct word by inputting any letter of the alphabet (i.e. they lose after giving 3 wrong inputs). If the letter is found in the answer, it will be revealed on the display. If the letter is not in the answer, the player will lose a life. Therefore, the player needs to answer 6 consecutive correct answers to win the game.
