### Description

With a 8x8 matrix as the playing field, the player, a single 1x1 bulb at the bottom of the matrix, is able to move left and right as a preset list of obstacles fall from the top of the matrix to the bottom. The obstacles are randomly chosen. For each obstacle passed, the score of the player is increased by 1. The speed of the game increases as the game progresses, up till a limit. The playerâ€™s high score is saved on display. The top row copies the obstacle that is falling, such that it is easier for the player to see where the gaps are if they do not want to use their eyes to track the gaps of the falling obstacle.
