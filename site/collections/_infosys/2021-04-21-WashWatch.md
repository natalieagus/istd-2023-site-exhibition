### Description

WashWatch is an application that informs hostel laundry users of washer & dryer availability in real-time. Through the attachment of vibration sensors to the machines, The status of the machines is captured and relayed in real-time to Firebase through Raspberry Pi. By having it as an attachment, new machines can be included in the database with ease.

Upon launching the app, users can select their block and view the availability statuses of all the machines present in the laundry room, with a choice to toggle between washers and dryers. The app directly retrieves the data from Firebase so that if there are new machines added to the Firebase, the app will reflect the changes immediately.

For laundry machines that are unavailable, the app displays the approximate time for the machine to end and the icons are in either red or yellow, depending on the remaining time of the current cycle. This enables other users to plan their laundry schedules while allowing residents who use the machines to know when to collect their laundry.

There is also a reporting system that will enable users to conveniently report faulty machines more quickly and conveniently, improving the efficiency of laundry machine repairs. (198 words)
