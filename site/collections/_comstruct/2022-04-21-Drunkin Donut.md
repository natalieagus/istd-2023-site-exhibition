### Description

Drunkin’ Donut is a delicious and exciting game, where 2 players compete to decorate a rotating donut by shooting sprinkles from their halves of the playing area. The game is housed in a beautiful wooden frame, complete with a delectable donut in the center of the board. The LED ring in the center consists of 30 LEDs, ample space for users to decorate the rotating donut. There are 3 buttons for users to interact with, the Player 1 button (red), Player 2 button (red) and Reset button (black - center of board). 3 displays help users to keep track of their current score and the remaining time for each round. The player who can decorate the donut with the most sprinkles wins!
