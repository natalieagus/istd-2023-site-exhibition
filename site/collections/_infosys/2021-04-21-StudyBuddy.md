### Description

Many students these days study as hard as they can in order to do well in their academics. However, they do not make use of effective study techniques well, which causes them to be relatively inefficient and waste extra time studying. This potentially snowballs into either burnout or scoring lower grades eventually. Our application, StudyBuddy, aims to help students with that problem.
StudyBuddy implements 3 major functions which addresses the specific reasons behind why students are not studying effectively and assists them to make use of effective studying techniques properly.

These functions are:
* Logging of their studying sessions, so that they can keep track of their work and what they need to revise, which also helps them benefit from proven study techniques such as active recall and spaced repetitions.
* Pomodoro timer, which reminds them when their study session has finished so that they can take a break and not overwork themselves.
* Providing quizzes regarding the topics that they have studied, so they can check their understanding before moving on.


Our application also requires users to create an account, so that the experience provided is catered to each individual user for their needs and preferences.
