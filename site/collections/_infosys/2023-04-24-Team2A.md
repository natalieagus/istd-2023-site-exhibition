### Description

No place to meet for group discussions? Library booking page too long and inconvenient? Forgot you had a room booked previously? Fret not, introducing BOOKLI!
BOOKLI is a smart app that streamlines your library room reservations with easy auto filling of details and convenient appointments schedule. When you log into your account, your profile has your student details that will be used to automatically fill up your name, ID, email, and phone number during the room booking process. You can easily view different venues, dates, and timings in the homepage through our interactive user interface. Moreover, all upcoming reservations are formatted as a weekly schedule for a compact and organised reminder of bookings. To maximise usage of rooms, occupants must scan a QR code (in the booking room) within 15 mins since start of booking time to confirm occupancy, else their booking cancels and the time slot will be open for others to use.
