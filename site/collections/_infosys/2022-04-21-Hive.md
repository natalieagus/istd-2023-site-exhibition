### Description

Hive is an Android smartphone app that provides better desk management for smarter, more flexible offices. Following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies have adapted accordingly and have the majority of their workers working from home. However, current office spaces are designed around allocated seats and not adapted to the post-covid work culture. Current workspaces are also not conducive for highly focused work and unpersonalised as it cannot be adjusted according to user preferences. With Hive, seats are allocated more efficiently where users can log in to a seat only when needed. The interactive map and search function available in Hive further promotes collaboration between coworkers as one can easily find where their coworkers are allocated. With simple gestures like flipping over the phone, one can indicate to your coworkers via Hive that you are currently in focus mode, which promotes higher productivity. A desk control panel, which allows control of light brightness and temperature through simple clicks of buttons and shaking gestures, makes office space more personalized to userâ€™s preferences, allowing workers to be comfortable in the office space.
