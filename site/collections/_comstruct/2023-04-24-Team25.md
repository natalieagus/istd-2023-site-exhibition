### Description

DeezNotes is a mini piano tile game that aims to challenge players to improve their reaction time and ability to keep up with a progressively faster gameplay. This game is created using FPGA coding and is played on a 3x5 grid, where piano tiles appear randomly on columns.

The game objective is to press the corresponding button for the bottommost lit tile to accumulate the highest possible score. In DeezNotes, the player can earn one point by pressing the button corresponding to the lit column, but pressing the wrong button, or pressing too many buttons, or missing the button will result in losing the game. If the player allows the tile to fall, it will have no effect on the game. Once the player successfully presses 10 buttons in a row, the speed of the tiles increases, making the game more difficult. To offer a more challenging and rewarding experience, the game has four difficulty levels, each requiring quicker reflexes.

A seven-segment display shows the player's score, providing real-time feedback and enhancing the competitive element of the game. DeezNotes is an engaging way to test and improve one's reaction time and hand-eye coordination, suitable for players of all ages and skill levels due to its multiple difficulty levels and score tracking features.
