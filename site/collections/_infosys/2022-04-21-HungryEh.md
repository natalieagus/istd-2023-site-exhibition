### Description


Our application aims to resolve the lack of a system to pre-order food in the SUTD canteen as well as the inability to obtain food related information such as information regarding the allergens in the food items. Through HungryEh, we hope to help SUTD students make informed decisions about the type of food they buy, and make the process of ordering food from the SUTD canteen more convenient and less time-consuming. Our App allows SUTD students and faculty to filter food items according to dish name, stall name and its allergens, save favorites to their account, schedule an order from the canteen based on real time and allow payment using credit card/paylah.
