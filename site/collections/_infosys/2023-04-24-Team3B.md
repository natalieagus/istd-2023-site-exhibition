### Description

RESICO is an app curated for residents of any kind of communal residences (HDB public housing, condominiums, dormitories, etc). In status quo, residents did not interact as much with each other and lacked bonding activities or events to promote community involvement and neighbourly behaviour. RESICO implemented several features to bring communities together: forum-style posting board, media feed for events and announcement board. Residents can view the latest happenings and upcoming events to join by simply clicking on the RSVP button on the events page. Forum-style posting board allows residents to post and comment about various queries or discussions, making communications between neighbours more convenient. RESICO also provides an announcement board to keep residents updated with any important notices or announcements surrounding the communities. Ultimately, our app goal is to bring residents together, making it easy to communicate, share resources, events, and ideas for a stronger, more connected neighbourhood.
