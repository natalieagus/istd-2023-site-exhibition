### Description

ACcess aims to provide users with an affordable smart home solution, by allowing users to control their air conditioners (A/Cs) from anywhere in the world through Wi-Fi. With our product, we hope to provide greater control, energy savings and convenience to the user.

Our product features a plug-and-play setup, whereby the user may simply set up our device near their A/C and turn it on. The device will then store itself onto the database and will be highlighted on the app for users to identify the current A/C being configured.

After setup, users will have the ability to control any A/C from their phone through the app, allowing for configurable settings and to turn on/off their A/C. The app also supports the deletion of units and allows for search filtering of A/Cs based on name.

The app allows for the storing and applying of user defined A/C settings for their convenience. Users can simply store a preset in the app with the desired settings, and at any time simply choose an A/C unit to apply that preset to.

The app also supports the scheduling of A/C units, with user defined start/end times to turn on/off their A/C unit and with which preset. Just like an alarm clock, users may also choose to repeat their set schedule daily or weekly.
