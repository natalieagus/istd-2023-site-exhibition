### Description

Coin Runner is a 3-level runner game. The objective of the game is to avoid obstacles (red dot) and collect the most number of coins (yellow dot). The player uses two green input buttons: left button and right button, to shift the character (blue dot) at the bottom of the 8x8 LED array. The game is started by pressing either of the two green buttons, upon which the coins and obstacles start moving down towards the blue dot. For each coin collected, the player’s score displayed on the 7-seg LED display is incremented by one. If the blue dot collides with an obstacle and still has any more levels pending completion (level 2/3), the player advances to the next level of the game. If there are no collisions faced in any level, the player progresses to the next level (if available). In each consecutive level of the game, the obstacles and coins move down at a faster rate than before, increasing the gameplay difficulty. After either completing all 3 levels successfully (without collision) or colliding with an obstacle in the last level (level 3), the player is shown a scrolling display of “GG” on the LED array and the game ends. Pressing the red input button in the centre of the casing at any point in the game restarts the game with a 7-seg score display of 0, awaiting the left/right button press to start a new game.
