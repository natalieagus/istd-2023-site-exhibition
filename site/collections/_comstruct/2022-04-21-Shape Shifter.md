### Description

Our game prioritises memory. Two players compete with one another to remember the sequence of inputs that they have both put in. With each additional round, there will be an additional shape that has been inputted into the sequence by each player. There will be two stages in this game. Stage 1 allows repetition of shapes to be inputted with no additional decoding while Stage 2 will convert these repetitions to a new shape that the player must input in the sequence instead. With each correct sequence inputted in each round, there will be a green square displayed, otherwise a red square will be shown.
