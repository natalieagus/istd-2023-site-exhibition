### Description

Inspired by the Keynesian Beauty Contest, we proudly present to you “4/5 Mind Games”, a game of strategy and deception. Each match consists of 3-5 players, and each take turns choosing a number between 0-99 which they think will be 4/5th the average of the number among the players. The closest guess wins the round, and the first to win 5 rounds wins the match. However, watch out for a twist; if there are more than 1 player reaching 5 wins at the same time, everyone loses!

“4/5 Mind Games” is designed using 8x32 LED Dot Matrix, 12 buttons; 10 for digit input 0-9 and 2 for START and RESET button, 4 digits 7 segment LED Numeric Digital Display, and FPGA to program our Datapath.
