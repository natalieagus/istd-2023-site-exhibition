### Description

Hungry Hippos is our adaptation of a popular childhood game! Instead of 4 hungry hippos chomping marbles from a common pool of balls, there are now 2 hippos side-by-side, competing to eat more falling berries than the other!

To add to the challenge, each player can only move their hippo rightwards so they have to be strategic about their game plan instead of violent button mashing. When the berries fall and come into contact with the hippos, the player controlling the hippo earns points that go towards their chances of being the champion hippo!
As time passes, players may find themselves scrambling as berries will fall quicker, serving as a tiebreaker.

In our game, in order to implement game logic such as the counting of scores and the falling berries, we use Finite State Machines (FSM) to enable the transitioning between states. We then display our game on the Adafruit 64x32 LED Matrix in portrait, which complements the falling berries and rightward movement of the hippos better,!
Have fun playing our game
