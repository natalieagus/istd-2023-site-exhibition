### Description

Students often feel lonely and wish they can make new friends. The Lunch Lottery app solves this problem by matching students who are available at the same time for lunch. Users register with their telegram handle.

In current week, users can enter the lottery for next week by choosing a date and time that they are free for in the next week.

User only won't get a match if no one else has signed up for the same timeslot as them. To prevent this, we made the Populated Slots feature. On current week Sunday, user can view all the populated timeslots for the next week and see the number of people who have signed up for each populated timeslot. If they are the only one in their timeslot, they can edit their entry to join a more populated timeslot. Users can edit their entries for the next week till current week Sunday 2359.

Finally, when the next week comes, they can view their match and contact their match via telegram as their matchâ€™s telegram handle is displayed.
