### Description

This project is an adaptation of the popular classic game Battleship, where players attempt to guess where the opponent has placed their ships. In our game, there are two main stages - the ship placement phase and the attack phase.

The game starts with both players picking squares in the grid to place their ships. Player 1 (the “Vikings”) places down 5 ships, whilst player 2 (the “Pirates”) places down 3 ships and 1 bomb ship. Once both players have placed down their ships, the game continues into the attack phase.

In this phase, players take turns to select a square to “attack”. If the selected square contains an opponent’s ship, the opponent loses a ship. During player 1’s turn, if player 1 selects the square with the bomb ship, player 1 immediately loses, and the game ends. The game ends when either player has no ships remaining.
