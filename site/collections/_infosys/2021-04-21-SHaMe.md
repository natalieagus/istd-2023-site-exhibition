### Description

Students face the issue of having too many deadlines to keep track of, especially last minute ones. These information are also usually scattered between different platforms, eg edimension, email, teams. Hence, we have created a scheduling application that allows professors for different modules to input the subject and deadlines in one platform, making it easier for students to access and track these assignments. 

Professors will also be able to keep track on the number of students who have completed a particular assignment. This way, students would also be able to have all their due assignments, projects, meetings together with all the description using our application. 

There is no need to waste unnecessary time trying to compile all the different information into our own personal calendar since our application does this for them. Our application also arranges the assignments in terms of chronological order such that students can better manage the homework and assignments that are given to them.
