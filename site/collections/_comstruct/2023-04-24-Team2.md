### Description

Our electronic game is called Lumberjack, in which your goal is to chop a tree while avoiding the falling branches which descend with every chop. With every chop the player makes by pressing the left/right button, their score will also increase, and is indicated by the number on the tree trunk at the centre of the screen. The game session has a timer which will automatically end the game should it run out. It is represented visually by an encroaching red down the green tree trunk. Once the trunk has turned fully red, it will trigger game over. By chopping the tree, the player can increment the timer by small amounts, pushing back the spread of the red. We introduce difficulty levels by making it so that as the player progresses and increases their score, it becomes increasingly harder to keep the red at bay.
