### Description

Users may find it difficult to book different facilities due to the absence of a centralized app or system. This goes against the principle of least effort and may discourage users from booking spaces if there are too many obstacles. Another issue is that users need to be aware of the various booking processes and the specific website or page to use. This creates additional work for both administrators and users when physically visiting the venues.

Our team proposes a solution called BookEase, a one-stop-shop app that simplifies the booking process for different facilities. The app will offer several advantages, including greater convenience, as users can book various facilities in one place, saving time and effort. BookEase will also streamline the booking process, allowing users to focus on their tasks while the app handles everything from start to finish.
