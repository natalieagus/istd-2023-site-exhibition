### Description

Hawker Helper is an All-in-one App for new and old Hawkers to keep track of their orders, recipes and inventory. Since the pandemic, it has been hard for new hawkers to maintain their stores due to rising costs and high turnover rates.

To solve this, our app aims to automate inventory management, streamline training processes and help with order taking and tracking.

Hence, our application has a few main pages: Ingredients page, Recipes page, Add orders page, view orders page and transaction history page.

User data of hawkers are stored in a database using Firebase, and these data can be updated using the application. Ingredients and recipes can be customised and using the application, they can place orders, reducing the need of a dedicated point-of-sale system.

Furthemore, whenever orders are completed, ingredient stock will be automatically deducted in the database, and the orders will be saved so users can view their sales history. This allows stall owners to easily track their inventory in real-time, so they can easily see what ingredients they have currently available.
