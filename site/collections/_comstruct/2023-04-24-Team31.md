### Description

This project is a Guitar Hero inspired game. The game is played on a 5 by 16 grid of LED lights along with 16 buttons. The goal of the game is to complete as many levels as possible.

At every time interval, a random configuration of lights will be generated and displayed on the top row. The row will then descend and the process repeated. The player will have to press the buttons corresponding to the lit up LED at the bottom row.

The level will increase every time a new row reaches the bottom and from the 6th level onwards, the row of lights will start shifting left every time it descends.
The player will have 3 lives and each time he misses the button press, the player will lose a life. The game ends when the player loses all his lives.

Additionally, from the 10th level onwards, the time interval will decrease. This will occur every 20 levels, where the shortest time interval is reached at level 90. (Increase at 10,30,50,70,90)
