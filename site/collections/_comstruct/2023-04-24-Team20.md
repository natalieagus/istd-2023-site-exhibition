### Description

Introducing Stacking Alpacas, an electrifying and visually captivating arcade game that will put your reflexes and precision skills to the ultimate test! Built on a vibrant 9x9 LED sheet, the game challenges you to stack 9 levels of blocks to emerge as the true Stacking Alpaca Master.

Starting from the bottom row, players must use razor-sharp reflexes to press the button and release the "box" at just the right moment. The objective is to release the box in the center of the screen to perfectly stack each of the 9 "boxes." As the game progresses, the box moves faster and the excitement grows, making it a thrilling experience for both players and spectators.

Stacking Alpacas offers a unique gaming experience with its eye-catching LED sheet, responsive button, and beautifully designed 3D printed arcade housing.

Are you ready to accept the Stacking Alpacas challenge?
