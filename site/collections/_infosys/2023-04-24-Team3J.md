### Description

In the contemporary era, where busy schedules and high stress levels are ubiquitous, fitness has become essential to a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. However, Singaporeans still face huge hurdles in their pursuit of regular fitness, mainly due to the lack of motivation, direction and effective means of monitoring their dietary intake and exercise regimen.

This is why our team has developed an exercise software specifically for Singaporeans. HealthMate is a mobile application designed specifically to help users adhere to a healthy lifestyle by effectively monitoring their fitness activities while facilitating social interactions with other fitness enthusiasts. The app accesses and incorporates users' fitness data and provides a social platform to facilitate sharing of workout results, fitness tips and motivational support.
