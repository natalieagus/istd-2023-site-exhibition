### Description

The UnorthoBOX is a safe parcel delivery and storage system which includes a box controlled by a phone app to store your delivery items. Each box comes with a Box ID.

Once a user acquires a box, they can download the app and register for a user account of which the details will be stored in Google Firebase. The user can then unlock the box anytime or generate an OTP that can be used by a friend to unlock the box if needed. When a deliverer wants to deliver an item, they can key in the Box ID of the box in the app and the box will unlock. If the user is unavailable and would like a friend to pick their parcel up from the box, the user can generate an OTP to send to their friend, who will use it to unlock the box via the app.

The system utilises the MQTT protocol to communicate between the box and the app. The lock is controlled by a servo motor connected to an ESP8266 that is connected to Wi-Fi. Both the app and ESP8266 are subscribed to the same topic via the MQTT protocol, which enables communication between them.
