### Description

OccupEye uses advanced crowd intelligence technology to detect the size and mood of the crowd around you, updating you with real-time information and insights. It uses the Machine Learning Package YoloV5, to help detect the number of users present in each room through the cameras present. This information is then passed to our database, and finally retrieved by our app.

Our app denotes the occupancy levels of said rooms using colour indicators:
• Red – Crowded
• Amber – Relatively Occupied
• Green – Vacant
These colours are assigned according to the number of users in a given room as a percentage of the maximum occupancy of said room.

Additionally, our app has features such as search, filters, bookmarks, that help you navigate through the app and get details on your desired room faster. The login, register and forgot password pages of our app ensure user authentication and safe sign in. After this the user can access his/her bookmarks and customise his/her profile if needed.

In conclusion, OccupEye empowers you to make informed decisions about the spaces around you, enhancing your overall experience and comfort, as well as saving time. Our innovative and user-friendly app, backed by cutting-edge technology, ensures that you can effortlessly navigate through various rooms and venues, always staying one step ahead of the crowd. Experience the future of crowd intelligence with OccupEye, and embrace a more efficient, stress-free, and enjoyable way of navigating the spaces around you.
