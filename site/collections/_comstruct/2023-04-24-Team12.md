### Description

Sled Racing challenges players to navigate a sled through an obstacle course, their objective is to avoid obstacles and stay on course for as long as possible. Players must use their quick reflexes and strategic thinking to control their sled (move left or right) by pressing the left or right button to dodge these obstacles. The game ends when the sled collides with an obstacle.

Using a 8x8 LED matrix to display the sled (represented by a 1x1 red LED light) that can be controlled by the player, obstacles (also represented by white LED lights) will start rising from the bottom of the matrix towards the top. The sled must dodge these obstacles by moving left or right using the left or right buttons.

The game is designed to be fast paced, with the sled automatically accelerating and getting faster after every few increments. This makes the game increasingly challenging as players progress, requiring them to react quickly and maneuver strategically to stay on course.

Sled Racing is designed to be fun and engaging for players of all ages, with a high level of replayability. Each run presents a new challenge, and players can compete with friends and family for the highest score.
