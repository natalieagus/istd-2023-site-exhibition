### Description

SUTD Dawn is a group-making app that aims to ameliorate the arduous group-making process for group projects. The app introduces a social media platform where users can check out the available groups across their modules to find a group whose interests align with theirs. If no such group is available, they are allowed to create their own group too. Since it can be hard to determine if a group or its members are a good fit for the user, our app maintains a user profile for each user, to help the users know each other better before joining a group. The user profile contains a short description of the user, a list of peer-reviewed skills and links to the user’s website containing their portfolio. Similarly, the group profile contains a list of group members and a tag showing which module the group is created for. The list of group member names displayed in the group profile links to each user’s profile, allowing for an easy reference to each of the group members strengths.
