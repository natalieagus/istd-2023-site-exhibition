### Description

Raiders of Hanoi is a spin on the famous Towers of Hanoi puzzle, built and implemented on the Alchitry Au. As the tower raider, attempt to transfer all the disks from the leftmost tower to the rightmost tower, with the caveat that a smaller disk can only be put on top of a larger disk. And did we mention that you will be dodging the guardians of the disks who will attempt to catch you? It will be game over for you if you are caught! Control your raider with the joystick, pick up and put down the disks with the blue button, press the red button to try again and most of all, have fun.
