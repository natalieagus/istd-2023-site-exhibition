### Description

SUTDFolio is the one-stop center of exhibition for all projects that originate from Singapore University of Technology and Design. Ranging from innovative undergraduate projects to cutting edge research theses, SUTDFolio aims to make every brainchild of the SUTD community visible to a wider audience. Projects can be found on the project feed with a short description with more details available on click. 

Uploaded information such as project images, a description, and pillar/course information will be visible to the general public, which can include potential employers who can contact the team via the attached LinkedIn profiles or email addresses. 

A search function is available for individuals looking for projects of a specific focus. SUTD students can register and log in using their school email address to upload their projects and add descriptors via the project upload page. Team members who were added to the project can edit the project information as well.
