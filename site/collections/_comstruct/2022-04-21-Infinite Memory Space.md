### Description

This project is an engaging memory game to test and strengthen one’s memory. It involves 4 LEDs, each having a different colour, and 6 buttons: 4 of them each having a colour corresponding to each of the colours of the LEDs, a white button to start the game, and a black button to clear the user’s input. Players need to clear as many rounds as they can.

Pressing the white button starts a new game and sets the score to 0. For each stage, a total of 8 LEDs will light up, one at a time. Players must press the buttons corresponding to the colour sequence presented to them. Each button pressed increases the level.

Pressing the buttons that matches the sequence that the LEDs light up resets the level to 0, increases the score by 1, and displays a new colour sequence to players; otherwise, both the level and score are reset to 0, marking the end of the game.

If users accidentally press the wrong button before eight buttons are pressed, he can reset by pressing the black button (the score remains unchanged). Thereafter, he can press the buttons to match the sequence of LEDs that light up.
