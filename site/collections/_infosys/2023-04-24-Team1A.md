### Description

GrocerEase is an intuitive application that stores nutritional information about grocery items to be easily accessed by users through barcode scanning, allowing them to make more informed decisions about the purchases they make.

Our nutritional data is graded according to healthy levels, each categorized as a unique colour, providing users with an easy-to-understand rating system. Furthermore, users, when creating their own profiles, can indicate whether they have any health issues that will affect the normal levels of nutrients of what is considered ‘healthy’ for them. The relevant nutrients will then have their graded categories edited to accommodate for their issue. GrocerEase also goes one step ahead in allowing users to compare two grocery items of their choice, whether it is from barcode scanning, or their personalized favorites and history pages!

All the nutritional data and groceries are crowdfunded, where users can add new items, with their respective barcode IDs and nutritional content, into the real-time database GrocerEase has adopted. This item and its information can then be accessed by other users.

Shop Smarter, Eat Healthier, with GrocerEase!
