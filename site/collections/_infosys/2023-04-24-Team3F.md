### Description

Are you sick of soloQ? Want to game with friends but don’t have any? S.A.L.T. is here to spice up your gaming life, find your duoQ partner today!

Register your games, then choose a game to match by and quickly find other players. Once you find a successful match, add them in-game using their IGN (in-game name) and have fun! If things go south, just delete and try again, you are safe on the internet. Otherwise, you’ve made a friend!

Safer (and cheaper) than touching grass. IGN are only revealed once both sides have accepted the match, keeping you safe from spam.
