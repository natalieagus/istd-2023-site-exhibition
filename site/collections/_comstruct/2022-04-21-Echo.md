### Description

Our game Echo builds upon the principles of a memory game. 2 players compete against each other to test their cognitive skills. The 2 players are provided with 2 buttons to choose from. The game begins when the start button is pressed. After the game successfully powers on, the first player has to start by inputting a sequence of length 1. The next player has to input a sequence of length 2, adding on to the previous sequence. Every consecutive event will make the players test their memory and continue the sequence. If the LED turns green, the sequence entered is correct, if it turns red, the sequence entered is incorrect.


Rules to keep in mind
* Each player can press exactly 1 extra button adding on to the previous sequence.
* A player cannot consecutively play twice.
* A player cannot press 2 buttons at once.
Scores are parallelly reflected in the scores display unit. Once the 5th round is completed, a winner or a tie is declared

Sequence termination:
If let's say the players keep playing their sequences till 16 becomes the length of the sequence, then the sequence terminates and both the players get a point.

Draw scenario:
There can also be a special scenario when a draw is declared. This happens if both the players together have the same score at the end of 5 rounds. This can occur when there has been a draw in any of the rounds.
