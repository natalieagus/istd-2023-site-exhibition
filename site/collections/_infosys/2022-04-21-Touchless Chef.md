### Description

Are you an aspiring home chef? Or perhaps looking to start home cooking but hate having to scroll through your phone with wet or dirty hands to look at the recipe? Touchless Chef is your perfect solution.

This app utilises hand tracking for touchless scrolling, eliminating any mess you could make while referring to the recipe. Upon opening the app, click on the top left corner to choose a cuisine. You can try out our recipes which are already included or you can simply make your own. To do that, click on the top right corner, follow our instructions to add an image, meal type and cooking time. 

Followed by adding ingredients and instructions to complete. Now whenever you want to start cooking, open your recipe and click on the “start tracking” button, a camera window at the bottom of your screen would appear for our hand tracking function. Either position your hand with the index finger pointing up to scroll up, or point it down to scroll down. It is able to detect your hands from a reasonable distance in the kitchen so you can be rest assured.

Hands free, mess free. Enjoy your cooking experience with us.
