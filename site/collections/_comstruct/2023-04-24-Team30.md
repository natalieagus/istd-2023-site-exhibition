### Description

We aimed to create a game which teaches the player about morse code, specifically the digits. The gist of the game is that the player is shown a digit, then he has to input the corresponding morse code pattern of the digit, using the dual paddle key. Pressing the left paddle results in a ‘dot’ input, while pressing the right one gives a ‘dash’. After giving 5 inputs, the round’s score will be calculated, which is the number of correct inputs in the correct positions. This repeats for 5 rounds after which, the total score will be displayed. At the start, users can select ‘easy mode’ where the patterns corresponding to the displayed digit will be played out before the user has to input it, while in ‘hard mode’, the pattern will not be played.
