### Description

Little Learners is an Android application that provides a comprehensive and inclusive learning experience for children. Currently, many existing resources available to teach children are either outdated or lack the necessary features to effectively engage children in their learning process. With our application, Little Learners, we aim to teach children by incorporating technology that serves as a fun way for children to revise and reinforce their learning.

So, how would our application work? When the children first enter the application, they are able to choose between 3 features: Alphabets, Numbers and Shapes. They can click on whichever theme that interests them. When they enter the selected theme, a list of alphabets, numbers or shapes will be displayed. For example, the child taps into “Alphabets” and the screen will display the letters A to Z. To find out more about each alphabet, he/she can tap on it. When tapped, the screen will show an image showing the example of a word starting with that letter (E.g. A for Apple), as well as an audio of the letter's pronunciation. This would work similarly for our “Numbers” and “Shapes” features. With our application, children can kick start their education journey by easily exposing themselves to these basic building blocks of language and communication at a young age.
