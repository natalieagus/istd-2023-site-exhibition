### Description

Blahaj.io is a snake inspired game involving 3 players. Blahaj.io is built using beta CPU datapath with slight modification. The game interface is created by using an external screen (64 x 32 LED Matrix) and 6 light buttons. Each player will be controlling 1 snake and competing against each other. Players will be given 2 buttons each (left and right button) to control the snakeâ€™s movement. Players must prevent their own snake from colliding head on with their two opponents' snakes, its own body and the arena walls. The goal of the game is to survive as long as they can until only one player is left. The winner of the game is the last snake alive.
