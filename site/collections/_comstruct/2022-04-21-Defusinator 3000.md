### Description

This game simulates the experience of defusing a bomb. Each button in the grid below corresponds to a LED above. Once the bomb is switched “on”, the player has 100 seconds to press the buttons in order to turn all the lights off. Pressing a button inverts the lights and those adjacent to them (in the shape of a cross) - e.g. if the light was “on”, it becomes “off” and vice versa. The player will clear the level if they switch off all the lights, and they need to clear 3 levels, within the time limit, to complete the base mode.

After the base mode, players can decide if they want to end the game by pressing the “Reset” button, or continue onto the frenzy mode by pressing the “Start” button. In the frenzy mode, players have the remainder of the time from the base mode to complete each round and this continues for an unlimited number of rounds as long as the timer countdown does not hit zero. Each cleared round adds an additional point to the player's total score. The goal of this mode is to rack up the highest number of points. Once the timer ends, the game concludes and the players will be given their total score.

So player, will you compete and see if you’ll be the ultimate Defusinator 3000?
