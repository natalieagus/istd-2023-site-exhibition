### Description

This project is a very helpful smartphone app, so helpful that it’s not [fill in 100-200 words of description].

Tanah Merah Ferry Terminals faces huge challenges with overcrowding and boarding. This issue arises from the unnecessary waiting time, especially for the various queues in the boarding processes as well as the very small boarding gate holding area, together with passengers arriving much earlier than the designated time for their ferry, the small ferry terminal with an estimated land area of 100 metres by 90 metres further exacerbates this challenges.

SailPass is a one-stop app that facilitates a more efficient and pleasant ferry boarding experience for passengers at Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal.

Our app has several objectives, which are to remove the need for paper-based boarding passes, cut down the unnecessary waiting time from the queues and time spent at the boarding gate holding area as well as minimise the contact and interaction between staff and passengers. To meet our objectives, our group then designed several features such as an e-Boarding Pass page, a Checklist page, a Ferry Booking page, and an account page.

Especially during the ongoing pandamic, minimising contact between passengers and staff helps in managing the current situation and helps keep the spread of the virus in control.
