### Description

Voluntr is an Android application that streamlines the process of volunteering between volunteers and organizers. Youths in Singapore have been more keen to volunteer but have little to no knowledge of how to get started or how to find volunteering opportunities that suit their needs. Voluntr creates a simplistic and more accessible way to enable youths of Singapore to volunteer more by integrating popular user interfaces that have been adapted from dating apps. This interface is more friendly to youths as they only need to swipe to look through the different events available, by swiping left to ignore the event that they are uninterested in and swiping right to join if they are keen in. Voluntr also encourages youths to actively find volunteering events to participate in through the badge tier system, the more events that they volunteer in, the higher tier they will be in. Overall, this brings ease and suits the needs of youths to increase their frequency of using the app as well as increase volunteer activity in Singapore, swiping right to a better world.
