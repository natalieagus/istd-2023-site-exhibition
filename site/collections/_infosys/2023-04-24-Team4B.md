### Description

This project tackles the problem of less than desired social interaction between residents of the same community. Our app, Nexus, aims to provide a platform that promotes interaction between residents by allowing them to form connections through creating and accepting help requests. The current target audience is SUTD hostel residents.

The two main features of Nexus are creating and accepting requests as well as earning stars and voucher redemption.

The requests would be simple tasks (with a difficulty rating 1-5 from the creator) that community members can do for each other, such as buying groceries or food (upon request creation, choose “Request Type” from a drop-down list). Users can click on the “Request Feed” button on the main page to view a scrollable list of requests from other users as well as click on the “User” button on the main page to access a log of created requests, accepted created requests and accepted requests.

When users accept and complete requests, they will earn stars (based on the difficulty rating of the request; stars can be viewed on the User page) which can be used to redeem vouchers (by clicking on the “Voucher Redemption” button on the main page).
