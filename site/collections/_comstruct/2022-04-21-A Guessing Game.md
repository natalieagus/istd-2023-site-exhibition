### Description

We have built a game whereby two players have to compete by correctly guessing a random number ranging from 0 to 16, by observing the LED matrix of patterned lights. The first player who guesses correctly for 3 rounds will be declared as the winner. The game’s architecture comprises a central 7-segment display where a timer will be displayed, and a 4x4 matrix of yellow LEDs which represents the correct number. The players must select their guess number using increase value, decrease value and a submit button. The game’s structure is such that every time the number is matched by the quicker participant, the round ends and that participant will be awarded with a point accompanied by a lit up blue LED. The first player who achieves 3 points first will win, with 3 lit up blue LEDs.
