### Description

HomeGuard is a camera surveillance system app that is affordable and highly customisable. It offers users the freedom to decide the scale of the system depending on individual needs. Users are free to decide how many cameras to set up; all the users need is to register an account with us. Upon logging in, the user will be prompted to enter an IP address for his/her first camera and its name. 

The next time they launch the app, a list of registered cameras will be presented to the users. Users can access the cameras' live feed by selecting them individually from the list. We offer the option for the users to remove the camera individually or "Reset", which clears every camera the user had registered on the app. 

There is also a "Call for help" feature for users if they need to call someone for help; it is a shortcut that brings users to their default Phone app to make a call. If you want to safeguard your house and assets without spending too much on a surveillance system, HomeGuard is for you.
