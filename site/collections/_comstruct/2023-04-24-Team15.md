### Description

Mastermind is a challenging memory game that revolves around the exciting concept of code-breaking. The game features a predetermined sequence of colors, which players must decode through strategic guessing and deduction with a twist. An imposter lurks within the game! The objective is to correctly guess the hidden color code with a maximum of 8 attempts allowed.
Players can see two sets of LED lights, one used for storing the playerâ€™s guess and the second half showing the hints of the guess for each attempt. There are two buttons that players can use, the red triangle button to change the color and the green square button to move on to the next position as well as to confirm the answer.

Players utilize their cognitive skills, including memory, and logical reasoning, to deduce the correct colors and their respective positions in the code. With each attempt, the game provides feedback in the form of hints, indicating the accuracy of the guessed colors and their positions. This feedback allows players to refine their strategy and make informed decisions in subsequent attempts, bringing an element of critical thinking and problem-solving to the game.
