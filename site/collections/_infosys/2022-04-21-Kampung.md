### Description
Lazy or too busy to cook or buy food? Look no further, ask someone on the way to get it for you! Kampung is a C2C food app where users can post and accept ‘dabao’ (takeaway) requests.

Hungry users can create a request detailing what food they want and from where. This request will then be viewable to all users of the app. Users who are near the location can accept the request and buy back the food for the hungry user. They can coordinate through their telegram handles to discuss the details and tips involved. Once the food is delivered, the hungry user can confirm his/her food is delivered and the request will be removed from the database.
