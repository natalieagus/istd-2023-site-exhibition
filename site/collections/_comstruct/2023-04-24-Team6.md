### Description

The game Othello is a strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid involving 2 players. The game relies heavily on individual skill in achieving “mobility optimisation”, which involves the maximising of your possible moves while minimising that of your opponent’s. It is estimated that there are 10^28 legal moves within the 8x8 board of Othello, hence making it replayable.

We have created a prototype of the Othello game using an 8x8 LED matrix grid that functions as the board. We call this game Othello-BEEP! A single LED button is placed above the matrix grid to indicate the current player’s turn. The objective of the game is to capture more of your opponent’s pieces within the course of the game. At the same time, Othello BEEP! includes a rapid-fire competitive mechanism with a timer that counts you down till your turn will be skipped. Additionally, there is more than one way for you to handicap your opponent. Placing a piece down when your clock is the same as your opponent's previous remaining time, will set your opponent's timer 5 seconds for their next turn. Think fast, Think strategically, if you want to come out victorious!
