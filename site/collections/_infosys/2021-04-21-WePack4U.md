### Description

To tackle the problem of long queues for campus food stalls during lunchtime hours and limited number of seats in comparison to the large dining population, we have designed a self-pickup app that allows you to browse the menu in advance and order whenever, wherever you want. The implemented features include a Login Page (which remembers user information and campus selection), a Register Page (for first-time users), Food Choice Pages (campus stall selection to food display page to food detail page), a Checkout Page (which incorporates order details and payment method), a Profile Page (allows for change of campus and edition of personal information), as well as a Navigation Bar (improves user experience). With WePack4U, you can avid queueing by ordering your desired food beforehand, browse the details of your favourite food, and even on a day trip to other campuses in Singapore, you will still be able to enjoy cuisine by simply reselecting the campus you are currently in.
