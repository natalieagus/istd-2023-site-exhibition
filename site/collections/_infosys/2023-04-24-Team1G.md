### Description

The SUTD canteen often sees long queues during peak hours, causing inconvenience and even leading some students and staff to forgo meals. To address this problem, a mobile application called Grab-N-Go has been proposed. This mobile application allows users to pre-order their meals, freeing up time and reducing the overall volume of people queuing up at any given time. This system helps to alleviate congestion at the canteen during peak hours, creating a more pleasant dining experience for everyone.

Grab-N-Go is designed with ease of use in mind for both customers and canteen vendors. Users can select their collection time slot, then select a store, browse through the menu, select their desired food items, customize their order and place them. They can then proceed to collect their food at the designated Grab-N-Go counter, eliminating the need to queue up at the main canteen counter. The application is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which divides concerns into 3 main layers; the Model, Controller, and View.

The Model is responsible for data storage and communication with APIs, while the controller handles logic and the View provides a visual representation of data. Grab-N-Go also utilizes the builder design pattern to allow users to specify add-on options for their food items, the singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the Order class is created per login, and the factory pattern to create different types of food items based on user input.
Overall, Grab-N-Go is a convenient and efficient solution for reducing waiting time at the canteen during peak hours. By providing a more streamlined and seamless experience, users can enjoy their meals, take a break, or attend to other important matters without sacrificing their health and productivity.
