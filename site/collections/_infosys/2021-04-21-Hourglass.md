### Description
The advent of digital devices has helped increase many students’ academic productivity, and also made various recreational apps available, which may serve as distractions. Although taking short breaks on such apps can be good for productivity, students are often tempted to procrastinate on their work due to the addictive nature of these recreational apps. 

Hourglass is a focus app which aims to help individuals to manage their time better by limiting the amount of time they spend on such apps. Hourglass thus allows students to take short phone breaks without worrying about not having the discipline to get back to work. 

Hourglass helps the user time their rest and focus activities and notifies the user once time is up. During the focus period, access to apps, other than those whitelisted, are denied. In Settings, the user can configure his default rest/focus time length, customize the whitelist apps, and write motivational messages to be sent to themselves at specified times. The app adopts a fresh and clear style, combining visual comfort and ease of usage. 

Further improvements include implementing a user database for account systems, introducing a friend interaction feature, and a points and achievement system.
