### Description

With our target audience being the elderly and their families, we have created an application that keeps track of medication timings and doses, additionally providing users with medicine information to help them make an informed decision when in doubt. Moreover, the application helps with easy transfer of data, where in the case of an emergency, one can send their medication schedule easily to doctors for them to understand the type and amount of medications that have been taken by the elderly. Our applicationâ€™s main purpose is to help elderly keep track of their medication as we understand that at that age, keeping track of medications is difficult, especially when there are limited care givers in a society like Singapore. As a result of this, missing doses or skipping medication that has been prescribed to them by doctors is common. To prevent this, we have created this easy-to-use app which eases the process of taking medications on time. This app aims to be a tool which the elderly can rely on easily to help them stay on their medication schedule and hence recover on time.
