### Description

The concept of RUNE was inspired by the mini-game Maplestory Runes. It is a single player game with the main objective being for the player to input the correct sequence of arrows within the time limit. There are 9 levels in the game, each to be completed within the time limit of 3 seconds. The number of the level dictates the number of arrows in the sequence, increasing the difficulty as the player progresses through the game. 

The game will automatically progress to the next level once the timer is up, regardless of whether the player has succeeded in inputting the sequence accurately. If the player was able to input the correct sequence, they get a point. The player wins if they manage to score all 9 points.


For the construction of the prototype, we took inspiration from the Playstation Portable (PSP) handheld device, giving rise to a wooden box with a large display screen in the middle and the buttons around it.
