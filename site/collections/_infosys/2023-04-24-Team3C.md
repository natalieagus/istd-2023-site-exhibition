### Description

We all had fruitful memories staying in the hostel for the first two terms. Following that, some of us had chosen to continue hostel life. While hostel residents (hostelites) wish for convenience of amenities amid the busy schedule, one of the hassles that is bugging them a lot is…

Hauling your soiled clothes/washed ones to and fro your room, which is probably located 6-7 floors away.

This is where we introduce LaundroBook, a booking system for washing/drying clothes. Instead of physically booking at the payment terminals, one can book and pay for washer/dryer usage through our app, and be notified when each washer/dryer cycle ends. In other words, we aim to encourage hassle-free booking for laundromat machines, aid in time management, and enrich hostelites’ experiences in our humble way.
