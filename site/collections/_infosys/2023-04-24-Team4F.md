### Description

Cereal is our take on a creative solution to manage classroom questions while not compromising on engagement and content delivery. Unlike existing solutions, Cereal allows peers and teaching assistants to answer questions from students, allowing them to clarify any doubts while preventing any disruption to the class as the professor is able to focus on content delivery while support for permission setting allows role-targeted questions. The app also updates real-time, so any changes you see on your device are reflected immediately.

Built on Streamâ€™s SDK and dependencies, Cereal supports Room creation and joining through WebSocket connections to a cloud server, allowing exclusive classroom instances to be hosted for all class participants.

To add on, Cereal also features the ability to upvote answers by other users, enabling answers to be vetted by the community and allow great answers to be recognised. Furthermore, students, professors and Teaching Assistants alike may also tick answers that they have accepted, allowing a satisfactory answer to be more visible.
Equipped with a robust database to handle question and reply history, these data are stored in Firebase, allowing our users to login and access their data from any device!
