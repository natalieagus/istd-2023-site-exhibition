### Description
Are you sick of spending your precious time on organising meetups for everyone in your group? Or multiple groups?

Don’t want to fill a schedule planner every week or so? 

Do you have that one classmate or colleague who is unaccountable for most of the day and you don’t know if they can show up to meetings?

Just download Scheduler and you will never have to deal with these problems again!

Our app is flexible yet easy to use. To begin, the user needs to sign up and login to their email account. As the app is all about schedules and groups, of course, the next thing the user must do is create a group, or join an existing group. The user can join and create as many groups as they want. 

All the user needs to do now is upload a calendar file (look for .ics) and they are set for life. Scheduler will grab their schedule and that of everyone in that group and provide a calendar that shows a singular schedule. Each timeblock indicates whether everyone in the group is free (a green block) or not (red block). And that’s it! Everyone’s life just became a little bit easier.
