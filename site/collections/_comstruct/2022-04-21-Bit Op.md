### Description

Bit Op! is a modified version of the original Bop it! by Hasbro Gaming. Instead of using voice instructions, buzzers and LED signal lights that correspond to each input (Push, Twist, Pull) are used. Furthermore, after each round, the LED signals will also show the playerâ€™s current score in binary encoding. There are a total of 3 levels, with progressive difficulty and varying scoring systems.

To allow more focus to be put towards designing a robust and efficient datapath, the hardware and exterior for the Bit Op! Game unit, including the 3 inputs (Push, Twist, Pull) were modified and repurposed from an existing Bop it! unit.
