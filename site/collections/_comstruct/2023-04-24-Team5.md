### Description

Whack-A-Mike is a multiplayer game based on the classic Whack-A-Mole game. The game features a shared display that pits two players against each other to see who hits the Mike first. The game is designed to be fair, with both players having an equal chance to win regardless of the pattern of moles that appear.

The game also includes a twist in the form of an exploding Mike that deducts three points from a player's total score. This feature keeps the game exciting and allows for a closer match, as the game outcome could change at any time.

To start over a game, players press the "Start" button to reset the scores. The display will show a flashing green or red Mike. The first player to hit the corresponding button will earn one point (green Mike) or lose three points (Red Mike) respectively.

The first player to reach 15 points wins and the game ends. Whack-A-Mike is a fun and exciting game that offers a unique twist on the classic Whack-A-Mole game, perfect for groups of friends or family.
