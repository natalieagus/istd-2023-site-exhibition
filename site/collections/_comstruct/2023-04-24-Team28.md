### Description

Players can prevent the lighting up of LEDs from reaching the bottom last LED by calculating correctly and then pressing the confirmation button before the aliens reach the base line. If the aliens reach the base line, the game will end.

There will be two displays â€“ one showing the current score, which is how many equations and or conversions completed. It begins with 0 by default.

Another will show the timer or countdown. This begins with 60 representing 60 seconds by default. It will countdown to 0. Reaching zero, the game will end.
There are 8 buttons for the users to press. There will be 8 LEDs above the 8 buttons. The confirmation button and the reset button both will not have any LED above them.
On the top right side of the input buttons, there is another display which shows the current value of what the buttons pressed represent (decimal value of the current combination of buttons pressed). This is to help the player quickly see what is the current value that they have keyed in, and hopefully for them to change their inputs if required quickly.
