### Description

TapDiz is a rhythm game that challenges the player’s reaction time. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. There are four difficulty levels to choose from - Easy, Medium, Hard, and Insane, with the frequency of notes generated depending on the difficulty level chosen. 


A fixed number sequence of notes will be randomly generated, and the goal is to press the button exactly in the “Perfect” zone. Depending on when the player presses the button, the player can stack combos and get multiplied scores if he registers a “Perfect” or “Good” consecutively.


For each of these difficulty levels, there is a corresponding Lunatic mode. The rule for the original game applies, just that there is a twist, whereby there is an additional indicator at the bottom of all the columns that will light up randomly. Players can have a chance to score more points by pressing the shifter buttons to shift the columns such that they align with the lit yellow indicator light.
