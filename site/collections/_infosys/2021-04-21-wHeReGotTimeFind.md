### Description

One problem faced by students when working on projects is the hassle of the procurement process. While looking for hardware, or other physical resources for projects, students would likely face a number of difficulties in the process. Examples of such issues include having to meet SUTD-specific requirements in procuring items (payment methods, quotations), and uncertainties in equipment quality, availability, cost and delivery time. 

Hence, our app aims to solve the problem by reducing the unnecessary hassle of studentsâ€™ logistical needs in product procurement.

Our app allows users to :
1.	Rate and review their experience in procuring and using products from various vendors, with the option of adding an image for each review.
2.	Search and view all reviews by buyers, with these reviews also consisting of details such as number of purchases and prices of products. 
3.	Get relevant details of the vendors that sell the products they are looking for
4.	Filter and sort results in search page based on product price and rating

With these features, students would now able to make an informed choice by efficiently narrowing down their options, based on what they prioritise (quality, location, price), by comparing the different options available via reviews.
