### Description

Can you tap as many blocks as possible before the bread finishes baking? Inspired by Piano Tiles, this increasingly fast game tests the reaction time and hand eye coordination of the player. Stop Loafinâ€™ around and get ready to Crumble!

How to Play the Game:
1.Press Button One (leftmost button) to start the game
2.There are 100 rows in this game, keep up with the speed and tap as many as blocks as possible once the blocks reach the bottom of the screen
3.Every 8 blocks tapped consecutively equals to +1 multiplier. Miss it, Lose it :(
4.Beware! There is a hidden mode where half the screen is blocked. Are you fast enough to catch them?
