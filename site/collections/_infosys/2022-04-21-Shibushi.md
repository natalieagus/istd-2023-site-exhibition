### Description
This project is a virtual wardrobe app designed to help people organise their wardrobe, create outfits and share them with friends. Our application consists of the following 3 features.

1.	Users can upload a photo of their clothes and classify them into various categories such as tops, bottoms and accessories. This allows users to keep track of their clothes and prevent them from accidentally buying similar clothes.
2.	The Build Your Fit feature allows users to mix and match existing clothes and create unlimited sets of outfits. This minimises the time spent to match outfits before going out.
3.	Under the community feature, all outfits created are automatically added to their profiles. Users are also able to search and follow their friends such that their outfits will be visible on their feed.

These features aim to simplify everyday life with easy access to our clothes at our fingertips
