### Description

Have you ever faced instances where you had your food expired in your fridge because you weren’t aware of when the items were expiring.
This is a very prevalent problem especially among working adults who don't have the luxury of time to check the contents of their fridge often. This could lead to wastage of food and cooking ingredients.

This is why we embarked on this project to address the problem of how we might reduce the food wastage at home by improving the tracking methods of the items in our fridge.

CookBook will be able to keep track of your items in the fridge and remind you when the day before the food expires in a form of notification. There are also additional features such as Barcode Scanner and Cart. Barcode Scanner allows the users to scan the items using their barcode to be added into the inventory.
Cart is an in-built shopping list, where the expired items are automatically added into the cart. The users can also input the items into the cart manually as well.
