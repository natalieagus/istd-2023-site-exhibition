### Description

Most students living on the SUTD campus, especially the hostel residents and the international students face a wide spectrum of student-related issues. These issues are multifaceted and can range from difficulty in obtaining basic project materials, food wastage and additional costs borne by the student.

Given the pain-points experienced by our target community, how might we improve the quality of life for SUTD students by creating a platform to improve the student experience on SUTD Campus?

Firstly, our UI/UX interface for our user has to be intuitive. Our design features a modernistic, minimalistic interface that minimises clutter. This is coupled with multiple friendly, easy access to icons and buttons to allow users to navigate through different services seamlessly.

Secondly, our app should be adaptable. Being adaptable means being able to accommodate a wide array of needs and being able to cater to these needs would entice students of various demographics. For example, a student that urgently requires hardware for a design module.
Lastly, the app is scalable as it utilises a real-time database to store user details for both the marketplace and the food announcements channel.
