### Description

MOMBRY ARM is a boxing memory game where players punch buttons according to a random sequence flashed on the game device. There are a total of 10 stages of increasing difficulty in each round, with an increasing sequence of LEDs shone around the six buttons. The stage count will be displayed on a 7-segment display. Players can only advance to the next round if the correct sequence is punched. After each correct sequence of inputs, green LEDs will flash. However, if a player punches the wrong sequence, red LEDs will flash in indication and he will be given more chances to punch until he gets the correct sequence. The player wins the game once he finishes all 10 stages.
