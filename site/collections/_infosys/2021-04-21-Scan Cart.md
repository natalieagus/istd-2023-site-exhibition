### Description

This project is a smartphone app targeted at the elderly, allowing them to shop physically and choose their groceries without the burden of carrying heavy items home. This is especially because an increasing population of elderly in Singapore live alone, from 6.6% in 2000 to 8.9% in 20151 and have a higher risk of injuring themselves from heavy objects. Thus, we designed an app that makes use of Near-Field Communication (NFC), where elderly users can scan the groceries of their choice and add them to a virtual cart, and their orders can be delivered to them at a date and time of their choice. Since the app is targeted towards the elderly who are more prone to various ailments, they can use this app to record their health conditions and look out for the nutritional information of the groceries they buy. A health alert will pop up should they buy something that is unsuitable for their conditions.
