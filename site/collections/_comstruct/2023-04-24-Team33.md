### Description

Whitejack is a game that involves two players competing with one another. The game will display a new number ranging from 1-11 every three seconds. Each player has a single button to collect the number up to three times. The game is played for 30 seconds, and the winner is determined by the player with the highest score at the end of the game. However, if a player's score exceeds 21 at any point during the game, that player loses instantly. Therefore, the maximum score for winning the game is 21, and the game ends once a player reaches the score of 21. Whitejack is an exciting game that requires quick thinking and strategic decision-making to achieve the highest possible score without exceeding 21.
