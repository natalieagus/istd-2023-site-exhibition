### Description

Our main game for this project is called “STACKERIFFIC” inspired by the retro arcade game merchandiser manufactured by LAI Games that was first produced in 2004. Players can stack the blocks on this arcade game machine and win mega prizes! The objective of the game is to consistently align rows of LED lights on top of each other. The row of LED blocks will move side to side on the screen, the blocks will stop when the players press the button. If the blocks do not align directly above the previous set, any overhanging blocks will be removed. If the player misses completely, the game is over. The game has infinite number of frames to play and we increase the speed for every 2 frames completed.
