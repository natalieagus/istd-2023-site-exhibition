### Description

Within SUTD, there are numerous transactions that occur every day. Students are constantly buying and selling items for their various projects on platforms such as telegram. While these platforms are incredibly accessible, the ease of buying and selling is not adequate. Messages easily get bumped out due to the nature of these large chats.

Therefore, we decided that creating an integrated platform, on which SUTD students can handle transactions with relative ease, would be an optimal application to focus on. The app features a simple, intuitive UI of a Home, Search and Account pages. The Home and Search pages allows Users to view current listings within a scrollable Recycler View, and your Account page allows Users to create and sell their own listings.

All in all, we hope that this integrated platform can streamline the transaction process, allowing buyers to get their desired items and sellers their unneeded items easily.
