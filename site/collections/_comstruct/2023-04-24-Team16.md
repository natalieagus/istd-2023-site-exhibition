### Description

Our product, Taylor Dot, is an adaptation of the viral mobile game Flappy Bird. It entails a straight-forward yet engaging gameplay whereby the player navigates a dot character against the force of gravity by repeatedly pressing a button to keep it airborne, all while maneuvering past obstacles (in the form of pipes) that are randomly generated and displayed on the screen. This is a single-player game and the goal of the game is to dodge as many obstacles as possible. Despite its simplistic design, the game manages to captivate players, filling a void left by the discontinuation of Flappy Bird.

The player should aim for the dot character to pass through the gap in each pipe by occupying any of the pixels in the gap of the pipe. Each time the dot successfully passes an obstacle, the score count increases by 1. If the dot collides with any part of the obstacle, the obstacle generation stops and the game ends. Alternatively, if the dot character touches the ground, the game likewise ends. There are 3 different levels in terms of difficulty for this game: with each level, the gaps between the pipes become narrower.

A random generator repeatedly creates unique sequences of the obstacles, by varying the location of the gap. This ensures that the gaps are frequently changing, requiring constant movement of the dot, thus fully engaging the user.

The current score is saved and displayed as long as the FPGA remains powered, but it will reset if the FPGA is restarted. The score is displayed in 4-bit binary format on the LED strip right below the LED matrix display. The level is represented by the color of the LEDs on the score bar: green for Level 1, yellow for Level 2 and red for Level 3.
