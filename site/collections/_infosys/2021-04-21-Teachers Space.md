### Description
Teachers Space is an application that primarily serves as an effective communication tool between teachers and parents/students. We have identified two problems in this area. Firstly, there is often a need for teachers to communicate with their studentsâ€™ parents, especially in the primary to secondary school levels. Emails are often too troublesome, and we are left with mobile communication. As such, teachers often lose their privacy by giving away their handphone numbers to parents. This loss of privacy can lead to situations where parents contact teachers after working hours, and possibly much later in the night. Such circumstances pose as unpleasant experiences for teachers.

To mitigate this, Teachers Space implements voice calls and messaging over internet, allowing teachers to communicate with parents without giving away their personal numbers. In addition, the app has a privacy feature, with which teachers can indicate their office/contactable hours. Outside of these hours, teachers will be uncontactable via voice calls, and the app makes this information transparent to parents.

Another problem we identified is the scheduling of consultation slots between teachers and students. While there are existing measures to do so, such as through Google sheets or via email, Teachers Space strives to make freeing up of time slots for teachers a simple experience through a dedicated calendar view. Students can then easily see the available time slots and book consultations through our app for any teacher.
