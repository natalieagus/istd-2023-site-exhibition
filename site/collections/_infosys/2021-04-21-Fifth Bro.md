### Description
FifthBro is an Android app to streamline inventory management/sharing between Fifth Rows in SUTD. Currently, communication between Fifth Rows and Student Interest Groups are limited to Telegram groups and email chains – this can make resource-sharing a challenge. With FifthBro, we aim to promote intra-organisational sharing by providing a hub for Fifth Row members to share and request items. Also, to make it easier and more convenient to collaborate among various Fifth Rows for item rental.

At the start of our application upon logging in with a registered account, the user can choose from three features: “Borrow”, “Inventory” and “My Bookings”. Our first feature “Borrow” allows the user to select a required time slot in advance. To check out the item, the user would need to scan the QR code on the selected item from the desired club.

In the “My Bookings” page, users will be able to see the items they have booked. For the return of borrowed items, the user will scan the same item QR code. 

Our last feature “Inventory” shows the items listed by the user and their availability status. To “Add Items”, simply generate the QR code of the item to list it for borrowing.
