### Description

This project is an electronic game machine done with an FPGA and Lucid programming. Chompy is a two-player strategy game played on a 8 by 8 grid, using a WS2812B LED matrix. Players take turns to choose a tile, and eat tiles to the top and right of the selected tile, inclusive of the selected tile. There is a poisonous tile at the bottom left that the players have to avoid eating. Hence when that is the only available square to eat, their opponent wins the game. It is a simple game with many possible moves that allows players to strategize and makes players think for every game.
