### Description

To defuse the bomb, YOU will have to solve the two minigames below, in order, before time runs out.

First, for the wiring task, YOU will need to plug in the set of wires into the holes in the correct order. What might that order be? Figure that out yourself! (Hint: Look at the LEDs above the holes). Plug in the wrong sequence, and the timer will SPEED UP.

Next for the reaction time game, YOU will have to press the button attached within 0.5 seconds. Each success will light up the one of the LEDs above. Light up all 5 LEDs to pass this game. HOWEVER, for each failure, the LED will not light up and 5 seconds will be DEDUCTED from the countdown.

Fail to solve BOTH minigames, and the bomb explodes! This game will test your problem-solving skills and your reflexes. Do you have what it takes to save the school? Or is this goodbye SUTD?
