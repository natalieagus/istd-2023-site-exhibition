### Description

‘Chad To The Moon’ is a single-player, arcade-style game. The story follows the main character, Chad, as he goes through the challenges of academic life. Represented by a blue pixel at the bottom of a 10x10 RGB pixel display, Chad can be controlled to do one of 3 things on each ‘turn’. Chad can either dodge left or right (represented by his character’s pixel moving left or right), or ‘complete an assignment’ (which is represented by the ‘firing’ of ammunition to destroy an ‘assignment’ using ‘S/Us’).
