### Description

Based on the dice game known as Pig, our game involves two players competing against one another with rolling dice. Each player has two buttons, “Roll” and “Hold”. During their turn, the player can choose to press “Roll” to roll the dice, adding the result of the dice roll to their “current score”. However, should they roll a “1”, their current score is forfeited and they lose their turn. 

Pressing the “Hold” button allows the player to add their current score to their “accumulated score”, reset their current score, and pass the turn to their opponent. The first player to reach 50 in accumulated score wins.

Our prototype design involves a roll and hold button for each player and a central button to reset the game, five buttons in total. It will have five seven-segment displays, two 2-digit displays for each player’s current and accumulated scores, and one single-digit display showing the current dice roll. 

The prototype is made with a wood casing that is cheap, durable and pleasant to work with. Using laser cutting, we managed to engrave the necessary details and slots to embed our game components.
