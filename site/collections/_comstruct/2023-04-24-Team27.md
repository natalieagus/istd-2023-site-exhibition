### Description

Have you ever faced a logic synthesis question and wondered if it could be more interesting, more engaging, more fun?
ThinkQuick! aims to educate players on combinational logic synthesis in a fun, and interactive manner. Mimicking an arcade game, it is a competitive, 2 player game that revolves around logic gates. Given a set of randomly generated final outputs, players must configure the logic gates and control the inputs and output of each logic gate in their circuit to match the target output. Opponents will compete with each other and the first to reach a score of 3 wins! Logic synthesis could never have been more fun!
