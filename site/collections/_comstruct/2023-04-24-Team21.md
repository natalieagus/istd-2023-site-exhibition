### Description

This project is a recreation of the game “Flow”. The objective of the game is to connect matching-coloured nodes on the grid by drawing lines between them. Each puzzle starts with a grid that is scattered with nodes of different colours, and the player must connect matching nodes by drawing a line using the buttons provided.

Puzzles come in the form of 10x10 grids with multiple pairs of coloured nodes. The objective of the game is to connect each pair of nodes using a continuous line that can move vertically or horizontally but not diagonally. The catch is that all connections cannot overlap one another, for example the red line and blue line cannot intersect one another. For the stage to be cleared, every single grid must be filled up so each move must be planned carefully.
