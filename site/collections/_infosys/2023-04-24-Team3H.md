### Description

After finishing our freshmore terms in SUTD, we realized that there is a way to enhance the learning of our students here. Hence, we decided to create a study app to better facilitate exchange of questions and answers between students. The app has multiple functions that can cater effective and fast communication, such that students can get useful information in real life. This will bridge the gap in learning, as students can assist each other to learn more effectively. Additionally, students with no time for consultation with the professors or TAs would not be afraid of not having sufficient knowledge on completing homework or projects, as other students can share their expertise on the app.
